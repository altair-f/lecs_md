# Hello, world!


## I think, that the Git is very usefull for education

### For what?

For learning materials preparing. 

### Why the Git, when we have the MS Word?

Don`t worry! You can type Yuor materials in the MS Word, but to save tham in the Git, not on Your personal computer or some cloud storage!

### But why? Why not computer or cloud?

Most short answer: the Git is not storage. It is a Version Control System! 

It saves a history of versions and allows You to do many things with them. This is not single feature of the Git, it has many other excellent
features, like a sharing Your files for common develoment in Your workgroup etc.


## A base

### Github & Company

For first You must get some remote git-repository - You can think, that it is a kind of cloud storage. Most popular is the GitHub, very very
known in developer`s community.
